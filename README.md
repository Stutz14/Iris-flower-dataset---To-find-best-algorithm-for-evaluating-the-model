# Iris-flower-dataset---To-find-best-algorithm-for-evaluating-the-model

Successfully developed and implemented a machine learning pipeline for classifying Iris flower species using the well-known Iris Flower Dataset. This project showcases the end-to-end process of data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and performance optimization using multiple classification algorithms.

Key Highlights:

Dataset: Used the Iris Flower Dataset, which contains four numerical features representing flower measurements and a categorical target variable indicating the species.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted numerical and graphical summaries to understand data distribution, feature correlations, and class separability.

Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned the dataset by handling outliers and ensuring data integrity.
Standardized the features (mean = 0, variance = 1) to improve model performance.
Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% validation sets for model evaluation.

Model Selection & Evaluation:
Experimented with six supervised learning algorithms:
Logistic Regression (LR)
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Classification and Regression Trees (CART)
Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Compared performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best model.

Model Optimization & Prediction:
Selected the best-performing algorithm after rigorous evaluation.
Used the chosen model to classify unseen data, ensuring reliable generalization.
Tools & Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Outcome:
This project demonstrates how different machine learning algorithms can be applied to a structured dataset and evaluated for accuracy. It highlights the importance of data preprocessing, model evaluation, and selection in building an effective classification model.
